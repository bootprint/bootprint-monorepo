Customize is an abstraction of [bootprint's](https://github.com/nknapp/bootprint) the merging-behaviour. 
It allows you to create your own projects and engines (other than Less and Handlebars) and create 
overridable configurations for those.

At its core, it uses [lodash#merge](https://lodash.com/docs#merge) to merge configurations, 
but it uses a customizer-function that also supports promises and custom overrider functions 
attached to the object.

## Engines

* {{npm 'customize-engine-handlebars'}}
