## v0.6.1 - 2015-12-20

### Fix

* Added description to `schema.js`

## v0.6.0 - 2015-11-08

### Add

* Possibility to pass a file-path as `data` property to reference a CommonJS-module 
  containing a helper object, or passing function generating the `data`-object.
* File-watcher for `data`, `helpers` and `preprocessor` as long as they are files or functions with a `watch`-property.
  

## v0.5.3 - 2015-11-03 

# Fix

* Add missing dependency on `debug`

## v0.5.2 - 2015-10-19

# Fix

* Add `files`-property to package.json

## v0.5.1 - 2015-10-15

### Fix

* Use release version of `promised-handlebars`

## v0.4.0 - 2015-10-14

### Add

* Added schema for input validation

## v0.3.0 - 2015-10-05 
### Add

* Necessary methods to add support for `customize-watch`

## v0.2.2 - 2015-09-28

### Add

* Append engine and customize-config to each helper-call

## v0.2.1 - 2015-08-12

### Fix

* Errors while loading a preprocessor module are now reported.
  Missing modules are still ignored.

## v0.2.0 - 2015-08-04

### Fix

* Errors while loading a helper module are now reported.
  Missing modules are still ignored.

### Change

- The `promised-handlebars` module is now used to provide support for
  helpers that return promises.

## v0.1.0 - 2015-07-19

### Documentation

- Comprehensive README example

### Added

- Options for `Handlebars#compile()` can be provided via the `hbsOptions`-property 
  in the configuration
- Allow `helpers` to be a function that returns a helper-object (or a promise for 
  a helper object)
- Allow `helpers` to be the path to a Javascript-module

### Change
- If the input configuration of a Customize-engine is a Promise, it is resolved 
  before passing it to the engine's preprocessor. Inner Promises are not resolved.
- Replaced filesystem access via `q-io/fs` by `require`.  Try to avoid browser
  incompatibilities, althought `customize` does not support browsers yet.

## v0.0.1 - 2015-06-29
### Initial version

- Extracted handlebars-engine from `customize`
